# PirateChannelLooping

Note: I did not create the original WAD for "The Pirate Channel", and if anyone can help me give credit to whoever originally made it then that would be much appreciated. 

Here is a modification of "The Pirate Channel" WAD (a Homebrew Channel forwarder for the Wii) which has looping music!
